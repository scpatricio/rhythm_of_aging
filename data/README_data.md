# Data note (HMD)

This repository includes `data/PNAS_cohort_data_HMD.csv`, which is a derived dataset used for the analyses.

The underlying Human Mortality Database (HMD) input files (e.g., `cMx_1x1.txt`, `cExposures_1x1.txt`) cannot be redistributed here due to HMD terms of use.  
To rebuild `PNAS_cohort_data_HMD` from raw HMD files, download the HMD data using your own access and use the file `build_hmd_cohort_dataset.R`
