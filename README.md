# The Rhythm of Aging: Stability and Drift in the Individual Rate of Senescence

### Replication Materials

This folder contains the code accompanying the manuscript:

_Patricio, Silvio Cabral. "The Rhythm of Aging: Stability and Drift in Human Senescence." arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.04143 (2025)._

The aim of this repository is to provide a clean, modular, and reusable framework for estimating the pace of aging and decomposing 
it into its fundamental components using large-scale cohort mortality data. 
All materials are organized to facilitate transparent replication and adaptation.

## Purpose of This Folder
The manuscript develops a framework in which the Gompertz slope—a classical measure of the rate of senescence—is decomposed into three interpretable elements:
1) Baseline pace of aging (b)
2) A long-run drift term (β) capturing persistent directional change
3) Volatility of the period effect (σ_rw)

This decomposition allows us to distinguish:
- stable biological features from
- historical perturbations and
- persistent cohort-level trends

This folder provides the tools needed to reproduce these analyses.
